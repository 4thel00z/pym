In this chapter you will learn how to install python

On Windows
==========

You have to download the latest Windows(TM) installer from the python site http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi . Install it just as any other Windows software.

On GNU/Linux

Generally all GNU/Linux distributions come with Python, so no need to worry about that :) If you don't have it then you can install it by either downloading from the python website or from your distribution's repository.

For Fedora

::

    [user@host]$ sudo yum install python

::

    [user@host]$ sudo apt-get install python
