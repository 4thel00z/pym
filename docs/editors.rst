Using VSCode as your primary Python editor
===========================================

If you have reached upton this chapter in the book, then I think you step up
into programming world by using a new editor which has a lot more features
than our starting editor (mu).

`VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ is an Open Source multi-platform
code editor from Microsoft which I personally like a lot. In this chapter, I
am going to show you how you can start using it.


Installing VSCode
------------------

Download and install VSCode in your Linux distribution following `the official
guidelines <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux>`_. Please make
sure that you are following all the steps given in that page. You should add
the project repository properly (either deb or rpm repo) and always verify the
package (the gpg signed packages in the repo makes it easier).

Remember that VSCode ships monthly, means every month you will get update of
this editor with many new features and bug fixes as required.


Using VSCode

The above is the starting screen of VSCode, you should notice the small
information box in the right hand corner.

You can disable ``telemetry`` and thus sending the key presses and other
information goes back to the Microsoft collects. Go to the settings page by
using ``File->Preference->Settings`` in the menu.

Install the Python extension
-----------------------------

The next step would be to install ``Python extension`` in the VSCode.
Go to the extensions from the left hand side bar, and install the Python
extension.

Start working on your code
---------------------------

Now, you can start working on your favorite project. Open up the directory in
VSCode, and start editing.

Feel free to go through the `VSCode documentation
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks>`_ to learn more about the editor.

We will add a few more things in this chapter later.
